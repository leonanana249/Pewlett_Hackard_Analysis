# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
## Results 
•	Senior Engineer is the title leading retiring titles, followed by Senior Staff and Engineer
•	First and Last Name with a title can not become unique identifiers to locate an employee since there are more than one people who has same title and same name in the unique_titles table. Therefore, only employee number is the unique key. 
•	Only 1550 employees are eligible for the mentorship with birth date in 1965 
•	No manager is eligible for the mentorship program 
## Summary 
More than 72000 roles will need to eb filed as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact. The number of mentors is way fewer than the total number of retiring employees. Therefore, Pewlett Hackard won’t have enough mentors to mentor the next generation. 
### Additional Tables
•	The mentors can be further broken down for each title, so we can have a better idea how many mentors are available for each title.

•	If we re-define the eligible birth year from 1964 to 1965, there will be more than 19,000 mentors to train next generation
